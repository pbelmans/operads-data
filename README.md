operads-data
============
This repository contains the data for an "Encyclopedia of operads", and the tools to handle it. Hence the `operads/` directory contains JSON files containing the information, obtained from Zinbiel's Encyclopedia of types of algebras, while `tools/` contains some Python scripts to create and manage a SQLite database, that is used in [`pbelmans/operads-website`](https://github.com/pbelmans/operads-website).
